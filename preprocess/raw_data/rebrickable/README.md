# Rebrickable Data

This directory contains raw data downloaded from [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/), a comprehensive LEGO database. At the time of download the data had last been updated on April 10, 2025 (refreshed daily). The data will be processed and transformed for use in the Lego Challenge demo app.
